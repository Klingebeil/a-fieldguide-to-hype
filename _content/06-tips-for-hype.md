### Never take claims at face value
Predictions are, at best, a well-informed opinion, at worst wild speculation. Never trust the hype and PR-speak—always check yourself.

### Seperate Narratives and Technology
Though connected, they’re two different things. Try to avoid speculations about the future and analyse both in the present. Don’t hesitate in pointing out expectations as such.

### Check the Motivation
What interests does your source have in amplifying hype? Are they trying to sell you something? Are they trying to change your mind? (e.g. “VR is the future of work”, says maker for home office tools)

### Be a better news reader
Pick industry reporting over broader tech-journalism as sources. Don’t fall prey to speculations.

### Get a historical perspective
What is the history of the technology in question? Most are around way longer than the hype would like you to believe. Knowing its history makes you harder to fool.

### Get an on-the-ground perspective
The expectations of people actually working on or with a technology often differ from the people selling it. Try to rely on their assessments and ignore the keynote speakers.

### Re-Introduce Nuance
Absolute claims like “blockchain will revolutionise journalism” are excellent marketing but a shoddy analysis. Start with asking yourself, “well, that depends on…?” and fill in the blanks. Poke holes, re-introduce nuance.

### Never dismiss critics
Despite boosters’ claims to the contrary, never dismiss people pointing out the limits or even dangers of a technology. Incorporate them into your analysis.

### Create alternatives
The future is not predetermined. On the contrary, it will be as diverse, messy, and complicated as the present. Try to formulate alternative visions and challenge your assumptions.
