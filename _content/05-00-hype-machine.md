## A MisInformation Economy
The amplification of hype can come from many quarters. A whole industry devotes itself to repackaging hype as factual research: trend analysts, consultants, venture capitalists, and journalists. These actors wield considerable power over which visions are presented as the future. By relying on each other, they create a hype machine that launders claims and sells them to the public as facts.

The most striking thing about hype is how willingly people accept it. We want to believe in grand stories of innovation and a golden future, even if this means ignoring their glaring holes. Investors in particular readily promote every new narrative of technological disruption, despite startups’ record losses.

Hype is great at ensnaring seemingly smart people. This makes questioning it tricky. Once communicated by authoritative figures, hype is hard to dislodge again. It’s the cardinal rule of misinformation: making claims is easy, refuting them hard.
