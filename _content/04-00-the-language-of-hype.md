title: "The Language of Hype"
subtitle:
---

Despite technology’s aura of cold rationality, hype is explicitly emotional. The stories told have to resonate with people to be believed and acted on. 

To effectively describe novelty, hype has to adopt new words, concepts, and ideas but still be familiar enough for a broad appeal. To be persuasive, the language of hype has to balance the new and the old.

Buzzword (noun) — Buzzwords are shorthands for technological visions. They’re neologisms, referring to a technology and its associated expectations. You know what they mean, even if you can’t define them. (e.g. web3, 5g, big data, etc.)

Some buzzwords descend from specialized technological jargon. Here, the term has a precise definition, but the meaning becomes fuzzy as it gets adopted outside of these fields.[^1]
