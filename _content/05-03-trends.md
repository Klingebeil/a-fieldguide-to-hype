Consultants and trend researchers suffer from similar blindspots as journalists. However, they’re comfortable with their power as creators of a future rather than neutral spectators. As one Gartner analyst acknowledged: “That is how you know what is coming next: because you are making it come next.”[^1]

Analysts have a different agenda-setting power than journalists because business strategies and expenses are based on their output. But to create a need for their services, they also like to recount tales of imminent disruption and total technological change—change only they can steward a company through.

### Gartner Hype Cycle
While Gartner’s hype cycle acknowledges the existence of hype, it still frames a technology’s success as inevitable. There is no option for failure or repeated hype cycles, as in the case of AI. Instead, it depicts innovation as a linear process without the messiness of the real world. Ironically, this makes the cycle itself part of the misleading rhetoric of hype.[^2]

## A Word on Trend Reports
Trend reports exist on a scale between rigorously researched and cheap content marketing, and it’s not always clear where a particular report falls. The pictures they paint are often spotty and one-sided.

1. Their notion of change is informed through the lifestyles of its authors—primarily white, living in big western cities. Accordingly, they tend to focus on luxury problems and entertainment technology.
2. Trend reports favour the habits and ideas of privileged teenagers, Silicon Valley, and the ultra-wealthy. Their interests are elevated to an inevitable global future while alternative forces and visions get ignored.
3. Because of an over-reliance on misleading reporting or industry marketing, these reports frequently mistake the expectations for a technology’s actual capabilities.

These blind spots result in over-optimistic reports and misleading recommendations. At best, trend reports can be understood as an informed opinion on patterns of change within specific industries, never as a source of absolute truth.[^3]
