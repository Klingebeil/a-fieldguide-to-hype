Today hype is everywhere, oozing out of the news headlines, growing like mould all over my LinkedIn feed, and blinking at me whenever I open my inbox. It’s a curious thing. The next internets, revolutionary changes, disruptive gadgets—all right around the corner but never actually arriving.

Over the last years, I have been working hard on the disenchantment of tech’s big futures—either as part of a corporate innovation team or privately in newsletters and on stages. So, you could say I am a professional poker of holes into hype’s seductive claims.

This small field guide is the amalgamation of my thoughts on the topic. I tried my hand at a definition, catalogued some of hype’s rhetoric, and described some of the actors most benefiting from peddling hype.

While hype is not a bad thing per se, its use can result in bad thinking, bad decision making, and worse outcomes. Hype tends to obscure alternatives, robbing our agency to choose which future we’d like to create. Instead, it's created for us.
