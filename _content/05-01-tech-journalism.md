Tech journalism is often ground-zero for hype. Despite its name, the field is less interested in actual technology. Instead, it should be understood as reporting on the tech industry—in itself, a fuzzy distinction.Be a better newsreader and keep these caveats in mind:

1.	Speculations about what a new technology might mean for the future are a fixture of tech journalism, presenting a company’s marketing as factual predictions.
2.	Since journalists are encouraged to be the first to report on a topic, they’re inclined to copy the jargon and exaggerated expectations companies create.
3.	Journalists tend to report from a consumer’s point of view, often overlooking greater systemic issues and forces.[^1]

### Uber & The Gig Economy
Described as an innovative tech company by journalists, despite not actually creating or selling technology, and the precursor of the “gig economy”, the company was able to avoid regulations and labour laws [^1]
