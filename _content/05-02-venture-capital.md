The business model of venture capital is simple. A fund invests in several startups in the hopes of one or two becoming big. As soon as the startup goes public or gets bought by another business, the shares get sold—often at a high profit. 

This means venture capitalists will, without hesitation, hype up their investments. Not only to increase their potential worth—and thus the return on investments—but also to appear innovative, even if the peddled future never arrives.

Today a handful of deep-pocketed firms dominate the VC market, enabling them to set the agenda for the whole startup industry. The ideas these firms deem worth investing in will become a trend, e.g. gig-economy, creator economy, uber for x, etc.

Startups looking for money will incorporate these ideas to become part of the trend, and smaller VCs will jump on the train—in the hopes of profiting from later investments through the big ones.[^1]
