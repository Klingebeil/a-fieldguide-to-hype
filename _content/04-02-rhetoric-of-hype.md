#### Technological Determinism
Technology is seen as the central force reshaping society in the future. Though it certainly is a powerful force in today’s society, technology will still bend to the existing material conditions.

#### An inevitable future
Hype conceives the future as predetermined through technology; thus, resistance is futile. The goal is to instil a fear of missing out on future gains. Everyone will have to adapt and adopt or risk being left behind .

#### The Rhetorical Future
The future is used as an argument against valid criticism. Every problem and flaw will be solved at some future point in time — hence the critique can be ignored today. (“It’s early days…”)

#### Innovation as a virtue
For hype, the idea of innovation is a value in itself. Everything is revolutionary and disruptive. New and exciting becomes a substitute for better without reflecting on the larger societal implications of the technology.

#### The Social Nail
Technology is positioned as the ultimate solution to a social problem without addressing the underlying issues. Marginalised groups are used as a branding tool—a nail for the tech hammer. (“*AI teachers for the poor…*”)

#### Revisionist Histories
History is bent to fit the current narrative. Past failures are forgotten, and existing technologies are redefined as a part of the new (e.g. vr/ar becoming the metaver-se). The new technology is now part of a valiant historical struggle towards progress that only exists in hindsight.

#### The technological race
The development and deployment of a technology are framed as a race between factions or states. Here the fear of possibly falling behind is used to secure favourable regulatory environments and state investments, e.g. the AI race or the race for 5g. 

#### Techno-Babble
The misuse of buzzwords and arcane terminology obfuscates a technology’s actual workings. Techno-babble is used to overwhelm people unfamiliar with the topic and appear advanced and complex.
