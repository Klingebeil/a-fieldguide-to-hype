title: "A Definition of Hype"

in hype, expectations are shaped on purpose, often beyond what could be reasonably inspired by technological prototypes, scientific breakthroughs, or niche applications. Or, as Jack Stilgoe, Professor of Science and Technology, observes:

> Technological hype is not just exaggeration, nor is it idle speculation; it is an act of persuasion.[^1]

While expectations are a normal part of the development and deployment of technologies, hype is their weaponisation. As a result, hype has the following three characteristics and stages:

1. Hype is almost always manufactured. The vision of a lucrative future through technology is created in hopes of kicking off a gold rush.
2. If believable enough, the story is fed because it’s good business. The vision is used to entice action and investments; it’s further exaggerated and retold.
3. In effect, hype creates a financial bubble. In that bubble, actual progress can occur, but it will invariably deflate—often suddenly.

## The Dangers of hype

In hindsight, hyped-up claims are almost always wrong, and in the present, they can be dangerous. To attract support and resources, hype perpetrators will overestimate the capabilities of the existing technology while obscuring its shortcomings. 
People mistaking the promises made for the actual capabilities of a technology will make flawed decisions—often in line with what the perpetrators of hype might wish for. But these promises can quickly become demands. Stepping back from hype and readjusting public expectations is hard, if not impossible.[^2]
More than often, the claims and reality are so far apart that no amount of money and R&D can bridge the divide. When the hype bubble comes crashing down, it can ruin careers, destroy the trust in institutions, and hurt further development for years to come.

### Fake it ‘til you make it
Embellished figures, faked demos, or pitch decks for non-existent technologies—startups often come within a hair’s breadth of fraud. And when their own hype collapses, there are rarely any consequences. That is, if you’re not Elizabeth Holmes.
