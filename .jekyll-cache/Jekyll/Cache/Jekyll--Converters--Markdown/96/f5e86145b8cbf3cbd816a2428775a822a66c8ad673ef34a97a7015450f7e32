I"Ä<p>Today hype is everywhere, oozing out of the news headlines, growing like mould all over my LinkedIn feed, and blinking at me whenever I open my inbox. Itâ€™s a curious thing. The next internets, revolutionary changes, disruptive gadgetsâ€”all right around the corner but never actually arriving.</p>

<p>Over the last years, I have been working hard on the disenchantment of techâ€™s big futuresâ€”either as part of a corporate innovation team or privately in newsletters and on stages. So, you could say I am a professional poker of holes into hypeâ€™s seductive claims.</p>

<p>This small field guide is the amalgamation of my thoughts on the topic. I tried my hand at a definition, catalogued some of hypeâ€™s rhetoric, and described some of the actors most benefiting from peddling hype.</p>

<p>While hype is not a bad thing per se, its use can result in bad thinking, bad decision making, and worse outcomes. Hype tends to obscure alternatives, robbing our agency to choose which future weâ€™d like to create. Instead, itâ€™s created for us.</p>

<p class="small-caps tc mt5">never trust the hype.</p>

<p class="small-caps tc">always poke holes.</p>

<p class="small-caps tc">let a thousand futures bloom.</p>
