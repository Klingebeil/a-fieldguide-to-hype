I"Ÿ<p>In 1959 Gordon Moore, who later founded the company Intel, extrapolated a trend to make a prediction. According to Moore, the complexity of integrated circuits would double every 18 months for the foreseeable future. A forecast he later revised to a cycle of 24 months and is today known for its remarkable accuracy.</p>

<p>Mooreâ€™s Law quickly became an industry benchmark, with competing firms using it to plan their R&amp;D investments, fearing they might fall behind. This ever-growing power of microchips is the basis for the later ideas of accelerating or exponential technologies. In reality, it is the best example of the potency of shared expectations.</p>
