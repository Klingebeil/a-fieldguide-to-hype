<p>Technology is not magic. It’s not a force of nature, reshaping society by accident. Instead, it’s guided by social pressures, physics, capitalism, and the stories we tell.</p>

<p>These stories focus on technology’s place in the future. They revolve around the potential of the new and overturning the old. They are known as “visions”, “promises”, “trends”, or even “predictions”, but they’re first and foremost expectations of the future.</p>

<h3 id="self-fulfilling-prophecies">Self-Fulfilling Prophecies</h3>

<p>Our expectations of the future shape our actions in the present. Expectations are performative—in describing a preferred reality, they help bring it into being.</p>

<p>When technologies are anticipated to push boundaries, disrupt markets, or create new ones, they attract investments, resources, and political goodwill. Technologies with lower or negative expectations are consequently left behind.
As such, expectations guide the development by providing shared goals. In this way, technological expectations can turn into self-fulfilling prophecies, as exemplified by Moore’s law<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Technological expectations act as myths. Since they promise certain futures, they can neither be right nor wrong in the present. Instead, expectations are either alive and shared or dead and forgotten<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The potential of every new technology always looks great on paper, but reality has a nasty habit of intervening. To stay believable, expectations have to transform over time to keep up with a technology’s developing capabilities and limits. They’re grander and more colourful in their early and abstract stages and level out over time.</p>
